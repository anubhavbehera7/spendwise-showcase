                    I, <strong>Krishna Teja Kocherla</strong>, contributed to both system design and full-stack implementation of the SpendWise project. I created Domain Class Diagrams (DCDs) and Sequence Diagrams to ensure the architecture followed SOLID and GRASP principles, providing a solid foundation for maintainable code. On the implementation side, I built the Dashboard and Expense Log, implemented the Login functionality, and helped develop the Firestore Singleton class for consistent database access across the app.

                    The project presented challenges in integrating multi-user features, managing real-time Firebase updates, and maintaining a responsive, user-friendly interface. Overcoming these obstacles enhanced my understanding of full-stack architecture, collaborative development, and practical application of software design principles. Overall, SpendWise provided valuable experience in designing, developing, and delivering a cohesive budgeting application while improving my skills in system architecture, front-end and back-end development, and teamwork.

                    I, <strong>Saanvi Tatipalli</strong>, contributed to creating Savings Circles and Budgets functionality, and Dashboard and Chatbot UI.

                <p>
                    There were many challenges in maintaining the architecture and principles along the way, but that is a huge takeaway from this. Learning how to efficiently meet all the requirements while balancing the design patterns and principles learned helped me gain a deeper understanding of the material in this course. I also furthered my knowledge in terms of working in a collaborative setting, especially with Agile and Scrum in mind through this process.

                 <p>
                    I, <strong> Swaroop Rao Bappanad</strong>, implemented many of the app’s multi-user features, including savings circles, user profiles, and the ability for users to send friend requests or join savings circles via Firestore.

                <p>
                    I also fixed all Checkstyle issues before sprints and implemented calendar functionalities for the Dashboard, Expense Log, and Budget Log, improving usability and tracking for users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I, <strong>Anubhav Behera</strong>, contributed to both the design foundation and feature development of the SpendWise project. I created domain models and class diagrams to establish a clear architectural structure that aligned with solid design principles and supported maintainable implementation. On the development side, I built the Expense Log screen, integrated it with the data layer, and applied design pattern elements that improved organization and reuse throughout the app.

                <p>
                    Throughout the process, I encountered challenges such as structuring models cleanly, keeping data flow consistent, and ensuring the interface worked smoothly. Working through these hurdles strengthened my understanding of Android development, MVVM organization, and practical application of design ideas in a real project setting. SpendWise ultimately provided meaningful experience in planning, building, and refining a functional budgeting application while helping me grow in front end and back end development, architectural thinking, and collaborative project work.
