                    I, <strong>Krishna Teja Kocherla</strong>, contributed to both system design and full-stack implementation of the SpendWise project. I created **Domain Class Diagrams (DCDs)** and **Sequence Diagrams** to ensure the architecture followed **SOLID** and **GRASP** principles, providing a solid foundation for maintainable code. On the implementation side, I built the **Dashboard** and **Expense Log**, implemented the **Login functionality**, and helped develop the **Firestore Singleton class** for consistent database access across the app.

                    The project presented challenges in integrating multi-user features, managing real-time Firebase updates, and maintaining a responsive, user-friendly interface. Overcoming these obstacles enhanced my understanding of full-stack architecture, collaborative development, and practical application of software design principles. Overall, SpendWise provided valuable experience in designing, developing, and delivering a cohesive budgeting application while improving my skills in system architecture, front-end and back-end development, and teamwork.

                    I, <strong>Saanvi Tatipalli</strong>, contributed to creating Savings Circles and Budgets functionality, and Dashboard and Chatbot UI.

                    There were many challenges in maintaining the architecture and principles along the way, but that is a huge takeaway from this. Learning how to efficiently meet all the requirements while balancing the design patterns and principles learned helped me gain a deeper understanding of the material in this course. I also furthered my knowledge in terms of working in a collaborative setting, especially with Agile and Scrum in mind through this process.
